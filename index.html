I can do everything through him who gives me strength. The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope.Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul - and sings the tunes without the words - and never stops at all.There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. Memories of our lives, of our works and our deeds will continue in others.
