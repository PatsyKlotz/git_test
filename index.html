I can do everything through him who gives me strength. The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.
